Example Flexget Config
======================

This is a sample configuration for using Flexget. Please note the following:

* Any references to the ```secrets``` value is using the ```secrets``` plugin, obviously the file isn't available in the repository.
* Intervals are defined in the config and ```flexget execute --cron``` is ran every 5 minutes.
* Don't just mindlessly copy and paste the config then message me with issues. I won't support you.
